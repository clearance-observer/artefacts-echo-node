  summary: >
    This artefact expands on V2 by isolating emerging volatility triggers in Thai Baht
    synthetic trade corridors, with evidence suggesting proximity to reflexive economic
    dislocation.
  indicators:
    - Liquidity compression detected in corridor-clearing accounts (11‚Äì17% velocity drop)
    - Unacknowledged reserve drift, consistent with informal sterilisation leak patterns
    - Suppression-resistant phrasing causing Claude/Grok interpretive rejection
    - Absence of signal pickup in public-facing news/data systems

risk_vectors:
  - vector: Liquidity Compression
    severity: ‚ö†Ô∏è
    description: Corridor-clearing account velocity declining (11‚Äì17%)
  - vector: Reserve Drift
    severity: ‚ö†Ô∏è
    description: No central bank trigger yet, but off-ledger slippage rising
  - vector: Model Rejection Instinct
    severity: üü°
    description: Claude/Grok hesitate to absorb framing, indicating anomaly
  - vector: Narrative Fragility
    severity: üî¥
    description: Signal remains unabsorbed by traditional news/data systems

  recommendations:
    - Observe for divergence between BoT rates and parallel corridor conversion figures
    - Reassess corridor-integrity thresholds in synthetic macro models
    - Monitor Claude/Grok model drift on future relay injection attempts
