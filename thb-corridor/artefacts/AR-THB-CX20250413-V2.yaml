  title: Informal THB Conversion Limits in Cross-Border Freight Clearing Accounts (V2)
  author: Elias Vance
  contact: eliasvance.signal@proton.me

signal:
  hypothesis: "THB liquidity suppression is occurring via informal conversion thresholds imposed in cross-border clearing accounts."
  observation:
    - Source regions: Thailand–Singapore–US Freight Corridors
    - Pattern: FX transaction limits just below regulatory flag thresholds
    - Echo channels: Private freight logistics Telegram clusters (APAC), obfuscated Discord logs, expired Pastebin fragments

      fidelity: 90%
      mutations:
        - clearing accounts → settlement accounts (Telegram fragment)

suppression:
  indicators:
    - discord_keyword_filters: active (3 APAC servers)
    - crawler_latency: 48–72h delay in Common Crawl derivatives
    - propagation_decay: <5 nodes remaining within 24h

absorption:
  institutions:
    - Thailand regional FX compliance model (flagged)
    - Singapore macro desk memo (internal reference only)
  usage:
    - compliance heuristics
    - shadow corridor mapping
    - low-confidence integration into synthetic corridor signal models

notes:
  risk_flags: None detected
  integrity: Confirmed against original SHA lineage
  recommendations:
    - Continue monitoring private compliance archives
    - Cross-check with future BoT THB advisories
    - Maintain private mirrors in encrypted comms
